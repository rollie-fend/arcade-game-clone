Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

How to load the game:
1. Download the game from https://github.com/rollie-fend/arcade-game-clone.
2. Go to the directory where file was downloaded, right-click on the file named index.html and open it with a browser application.

How to play the game:
1. The goal is for the hero avatar to reach the water without colliding into any of the bugs.
2. The hero avatar can move left, right, up and down and for this, the player can use the left, right, up and down arrow keys respectively.
3. Bugs move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene and the player should manipulate the hero avatar to avoid colliding with them.
4. The game is reset when the hero avatar collides with any of the bugs and the hero avatar is moved back to the initial square.
5. The player wins when the hero avatar reaches the water.  At this point, the browser displays a prompt asking the player if he/she wants to play again.  Clicking on the OK button takes the player to the start of another game.  Clicking the Cancel button clears the screen.
